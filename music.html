				I started to play piano when I was six years old. My first piano teacher is an old Russian lady. She told me that every child in Russia would have music lessons after school.
				<br>
				<br> 
				Every year, I participate in Piano Olympics and Festivals. 
				I also have Christmas recitals at College of William & Mary.
				<br>
				<br>
				Last year, I won a second place in the Virginia Eastern District Musicial Festivals. The picture to the left shows me with the trophy. It has my name on the base. </p>
