	  Patrick is a student at <a href = "https://ycsd.yorkcountyschools.org/Page/4170/">Waller Mill Elementray School</a>. 
	  Waller Mill is a great school. My teacher there is Mrs. Folan.<br> I also have a friend named Caleb. In some of the weekends, I hangout with him.<br>
	  <br>
	  
	  He likes playing vidoe games and piano. I also like music and visit places.</p>
