	  Hello! My name is Patrick. 
	  I am a student at <a href = "https://ycsd.yorkcountyschools.org/Page/4170/">Waller Mill Elementray School</a>. 
	  Waller Mill is a fine art magnet school. My teacher is Mrs. Folan. She is great. There are around 20 students in my class. 
	  We have art, P.E., computer, and library resources. My favorite subject is math. 
	  </p> 
	  
	  <p>At Waller Mill, we read lots of books. We also have regular reading tests. I am reading magic book series. Books help us grow. </p>
	  
	  <p>I like music. I started piano lession when I was six years old. My first piano teacher was an old lady from Russia. She plays both piano and violin.
	  My current piano teacher is Ms. Kathy. She has lots of cats. </p>
	  
	  <p>During school breaks, my family usually go on vacation. Before the Covid 19 pandemic, I visited many places. I've been to cities on the west coast and east coast.
      I went to China three times. My grandparents live there. I've also been to the Natioanl Zoo and visited the great panda there.</p>
	  
	  <p>I also like playing vidoe games and sports. Video games are fun. My favorite video game is "Among US". Sports are fun as well. 
	  I enjoy swimming, play tennis, go ice skating, and play kickball. On weekends, I play chess and checker games with my parents.I also enjoy arts.</p>
	  
	  <p>I also like songs like Gangnam Style, Its my life, and Dance monkey. Gangnam Style is my favorite one.</p>
